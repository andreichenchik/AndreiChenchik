## Andrei Chenchik, iOS Developer
I believe that the only way to truly overcome a challenge is to build a deep understanding of the systems around it and then build your solution on top of that. That is why in my work I'm practicing holistic approach, system thinking and constantly grow my knowledge in multiple disciplines like Mobile, Backend, DevOps, etc.

I'm always looking forward to work and learn from dynamic teams like rindus, tackle hard challenges with lots of data, complex and snappy UIs to deliver business value to customers.

- Backend using `Python` with `FastAPI`, `GraphQL`, `Postgres` and `Redis`: [enableOps api](https://github.com/enableops/api-service)
- Web Frontend using `JS/TS` with `React`: [enableOps website](https://github.com/enableops/enableops.github.io/tree/main/src/components)
- DevOps, CI&CD using `Pulumi`, `ArgoCD`, `GH Actions` and `Kubernetes`: [local GitOps & IaaC](https://github.com/AndreiChenchik/local-cluster)
- Data, ML&DL using `Python` with `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `PyTorch`: [Simpsons DeepLearning](https://github.com/AndreiChenchik/dlschool/blob/main/14.1%20%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5.%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2/simpsons_resnet50.ipynb)

##### **Latest project: Simply Receipts ([AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/simply-receipts-tracker/id1586132989), [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreiChenchik/receipt), [Blog](https://chenchik.me/simply-receipts))**

I built this project from scratch in an attempt to solve a bill keeping problem that I have. It's 100% built using `SwiftUI`, using `CoreData` for data persistence with `CloudKit` for cross-device synchronization. One of the most interesting challenges was to use `concurrency` for scanning in the background while still being able to save data with `CoreData`. And I had to come up with an `algorithm` to parse a block of text into a list of cart items.
